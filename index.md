### Grading/class requirements

1. Hausarbeit (90% of grade) - Students are responsible for writing an orginal research proposal on a question at the semantics-pragmatics interface. Research questions should be based on well-founded and concrete research question. Ultimately, this question should inform an existing debate that we have covered in lecture. In addition, students will need to provide some empirical observation and need to propose a methodolgy for testing between explanations for certain data points. Students' exam papers will be assesed for 1) how clearly they can demonstrate why the problem they want to investigate is actually a problem 2) discuss how prior work and explicate how it has sought to address this problem 3) provide an argument about where prior work has fallen short 4) propose a novel way of addressing this problem 5) propose an appriopriate method to investigate this problem.  I have provided additional readings for those that want to deeper their understanding of a debate within a given topic. Additionally, I welcome students to ask me questions about a topic (given that it is relevant to the current lecture). This can be done before or after class or even briefly in class, in which students can potentially get feedback from other students. Having said that, it might be preferable to meet before or after class. 

2. Discussion questions (10% of grade)
Students need to prepare 2 questions for the required readings for each lecture. These should be posted on the "journal" section in the blackboard (Kurstools). These questions can range from things that you didn't understand to disargreements or skepticism about the authors' arguments, theororetical positions, and/or explanation of the data. Questions need to be posted on blackboard **Tuesday night before 10PM**, i.e. the evening before class. This is not meant to be punative; rather allows me to better tailor my lecture to what you did and did not understand, but these questions will also serve as a basis for class dicsussions. 


For students only wanting a “Teilnahmbescheinigung”, you will only need to participant to submit discussion questions and attend the lectures.

Also, we will use different sources of data to compare different claims/theories about semantic and pragmatic phenomena.
